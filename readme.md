# What is this?
Howdy there, this is a ARMA 3 tool that transfers a mission PBO to the MPMissionsCache folder. 
# Why is it made?
I made this for the unit where I play, ARMA Srbija, to save time on loading large missions (30+ megabytes) for 60+ players we have on a OP
# How to use it
You open the application, you select the PBO you click the button. Thats it :)
# How it works
It takes your PBO and copies it to %USER%\AppData\Local\ARMA3\MPMissionsCache
